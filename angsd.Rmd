## Analysis with `angsd`

**This is the primary program for analyzing the data from a population genetics standpoint. Be wary of what version you have (on the server or in your local) as scripts may/may not work with different versions. Be sure to update** 

This program has too many options to put here, but future renditions/updates may provide more explanation. 

 - For the best guidance/understanding, see the help pages: **http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD**
