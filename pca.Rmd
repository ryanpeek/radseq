# *PCA*

**This is a general way to generate a principal component analysis from your subsampled bam files**

1. Obtain and copy scripts:   `pca_calc.sh` and `plotPCA_2.R` and `pca_plot.sh`

2. Run `pca_calc.sh`
    - `sbatch pca_calc.sh subbamlist out` (out is whatever you want filename)

3. Make a clst file for plotting: `sed 's/_RA\.sort\.flt_100000\.bam/ 1 1/g' subbamlist > out.clst`

4. VIM (or other text editor) out.clst and insert a header **`FID IID CLUSTER`**:
    - (IID changes symbol; CLUSTER changes color)
    - Feel free to modify this file according to symbol or color as you see fit for the final PCA plot
  
5. `sh pca_plot.sh`  This should create 3 pdfs (but can be modified by modifying the script)

<!-- add additional code/examples here, Ryan will add additional PCA code and custom R script here-->
