## Using `sftp` 

To connect to the Cluster to get/put files from your local directory (your computer):

 - Open a new shell window using `ctrl t`
    - `sftp __@agri.cse.ucdavis.edu` where __ is your username for the server
    - `cd _/_`  change directory to whichever location on CLUSTER that has these files
    - `ls *pdf` can list the files of interest to make sure it's what you want/exists
    - `lcd _/_` change directory locally (your computer)
    - `lls` local list the files in current local directory
 - **`get` files from CLUSTER to local directory (your computer)**
    - `get *pdf` download all pdf files from Cluster to your computer
 - **`put` files from local directory to CLUSTER**
