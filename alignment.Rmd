## *Align Individuals to Loci*

 1. Build index of contigs: `bwa index final_contigs_300.fasta` OR `A_model_genome.fasta`
    - Files will now end in `.amb`, `.ann`, etc.
 
 2. Using all `fastq` build a list of the fastq RA and RB files into different columns:
    - `ls *RA* | sed "s/\.fastq//g" > bamlistA`
    - `ls *RB* | sed "s/\.fastq//g" > bamlistB`
    - `paste bamlist? > bamlist`
 3. Obtain the `run_align.sh` script  For example copy `cp ~millermr/common/run_align.sh ./`
    - `sh run_align.sh bamlist final_contigs_300.fasta`
    - It's taking all fastq files (`RA` and `RB`) and aligning to the `_300.fasta` file (or model genome file)
 
 4. This should create your final bam files   
 
#### Node Failures and Missing Bams

Sometimes the nodes fail, and you need to find/re-run scripts for certain files. Best option is to find/sort the files that did work, and then grep against the files that didn't to make a new list, then re-run `run_align.sh` script with new list.

 - `ls *.flt.bam | sed "s/\.sort\.flt\.bam//g" | grep -f - -v bamlist > bamlist_rerun`
