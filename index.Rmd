Welcome to a RADSeq/RAPTURE pipeline. This website was largely a working lab notebook as part of a dissertation, but provides much of the protocols, pipeline, and code used in RADSeq population genomic analyses. A summary of what is on this site is as follows:

 - [**Background**](docs/background_bash.html) tab has has info on coding using `bash`, how to connect to the cluster and to `sftp` as well as some additional R coding resources.

 - [**Downloading Data**](docs/downloading_illumina.html) provides info on how to get your data, split by plate, split by barcode, and add metadata. 

 - **Alignment** describes the main ways data will be aligned, (either [de novo](docs/de_novo_assembly.html) or [reference](docs/reference.html). There is also a page on [merging multiple lanes of data](docs/merging.html).

 - [**Filtering**](docs/subsampling.html) shows how to filter data for quality and number of reads. The subsample script will select all bams with reads above a given threshold, and then randomly subsample to exactly that threshold of reads (e.g., so all samples have exactly 100k reads).

 - [**PopGen Analysis**](docs/popgen_tools.html) shows a very simplistic set of analyses that can be done using `angsd`.

 - [**Colony**](docs/pipeline_colony.html) provides a short pipeline on using Colony with RADSeq data.  

 - [**NCBI**](docs/upload_ncbi.html) describes how to upload data to NCBI for archival purposes.
